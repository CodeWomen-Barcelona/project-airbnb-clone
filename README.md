## Project Airbnb Clone

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS, with the option to also use Bootstrap.
***We recommend that you first do the Flexbox project, to get more knowledge about how to use Flexbox.***

This is an example of an Airbnb webpage you can build. You can choose your own, make a screenshot and build your clone ([see the Airbnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/)).

Steps:  

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-airbnb-clone
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Airbnb Clone* as the title in your HTML (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. Build the page according to the example (try to find the correct font!)
1. You will be able to find the Airbnb logo online, but you can also make a screenshot and use that image
1. You can use any photographs you like, or take screenshots from images you find online. You can change the cities that are on the Airbnb page, etc. etc. In the **resources_info** repository you will find links to websites where you can download pictures, images, icons etc. for free
1. Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š

You can run your code with Live Server. If you do not have this extension in your Visual Studio Code yet, you can search for it by clicking on the small icon with cubes in the column that is most on the left in your VSC window:

Here you can search for Live Server. This is what it looks like:  
<img src="/liveServer_image.png" width="400" />  

After installing Live Server, you can start it **when you are in your HTML file** by using a right click, or using the button **Go Live** in the blue bar all the way at the bottom of your VSC window:
