## Project Airbnb Clone

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS, with the option to also use Bootstrap.
***We recommend that you first do the Flexbox project, to get more knowledge about how to use Flexbox.***

This is an example of an Airbnb webpage you can build. You can choose your own, make a screenshot and build your clone ([see the Airbnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/)).

Steps:  

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-airbnb-clone
1. Track your code with Git by using git init in the terminal
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Airbnb Clone* as the title in your HTML (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. Build the page according to the example (try to find the correct font!)
1. You will be able to find the Airbnb logo online, but you can also make a screenshot and use that image
1. You can use any photographs you like, or take screenshots from images you find online. You can change the cities that are on the Airbnb page, etc. etc. In the **resources_info** repository you will find links to websites where you can download pictures, images, icons etc. for free (for example, [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) for icons)
1. Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š

You can run your code with Live Server. If you do not have this extension in your Visual Studio Code yet, you can search for it by clicking on the small icon with cubes in the column that is most on the left in your VSC window:

Here you can search for Live Server. This is what it looks like:  
<img src="/liveServer_image.png" width="400" />  

After installing Live Server, you can start it **when you are in your HTML file** by using a right click, or using the button **Go Live** in the blue bar all the way at the bottom of your VSC window:

## Please note:
If you want to download a project on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo locally, on your computer. After that, create a new repo in your own GitHub account *with exactly the same project name*, and link the local repo to the remote repo in your GitHub account (see below). Why should you clone and not fork? It will show the project as **your own project** and not a fork of someone else's project. You can use it as a project for your portfolio.

You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during a CodeWomen coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and afterwards link it with a remote GitHub repo.

If you clone the project without forking it, you will have to change the 'remote origin' repository after cloning. Check the remote of your local project using `git remote -v`. You will probably see:  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (push)`

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub account.
